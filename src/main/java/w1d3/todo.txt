today we worked on our experience with files to made a fully functional grocery list backend...
so what you work on next should depend on your self percieved experience
if you want more array problems:

word.substring - return an array that is only part of the word - batman.substring(3) = "bat"
batman.substring(3,6) = "man"

we encounter in this "method overloading"  - having the same method name with different method signature
thanks to the variation in parameters

deleteAll(char) - delete all occurrences of a specific char

toUppercase(), toLowercase - see if you can solve this with just math using chars (remember, again, that chars
are numbers and that there is a finite distance between a and A)

if you would like to expand on a web api and either add more endpoints or complexity to grocery list, or create
your own api, go for it
